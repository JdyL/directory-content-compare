# [Python] Directory Comparison
## Objective:
Compares the content from one directory to another.

![How it works](how-it-works.gif)

# Requirements:
- Have Python 3 installed on local machine

# How to run: (Easy!)
- Open bash/terminal/cmd
- Go to directory of this folder
- type in >python main.py
- Follow the prompts with the first and second directory

# To complete in the future:
*As of 06/07/2018, it only compares differences relatively to the directory with the most content. 
Ideally, it should compare both directories to each other and list which directory is missing what from the other.

**This idea started when copying my music files to my OnePlus 5 phone and it keeps crashing whenever I paste in the same content.. So I use this to find out what is the difference so I can just copy and paste them instead of it crashing again.
